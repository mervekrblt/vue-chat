## How to Use
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/mervekrblt/vue-chat.git
```
    
Change into the directory and install all dependencies (server)
```
cd server

npm install

npm start
```

Change into the directory and install all dependencies (client)
```
cd client

npm install

npm run serve
```
